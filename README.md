# cg-in-cpp
Little computer graphics project in c++.

My attempt at following the text <b>Computer Graphics from Scratch</b> by Gabriel Gambetta, available <a href="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/">here</a>.

Makes use of the <a href="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> template library.

The code for saving the generated image to a bitmap file was heavily inspired by <a href="https://dev.to/muiz6/c-how-to-write-a-bitmap-image-from-scratch-1k6m">this DEV.to post</a>.
